Welcome the OSM Discord bot help :)

The arrows below can be used to navigate, and the `‚úò` to delete this message.

This is help only for the Discord bot, for more general OSM help there is a list of resources [here](https://www.openstreetmap.org/help), and most info about mapping in OSM is on the [wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/).
If you can't find info about it there, or have any questions, feel free to ask! :)

You can help to improve the bot, and these docs, on the [GitHub page](<https://github.com/GoodClover/OSM-Discord-bot>).
Report bugs and suggest things in the [issues tab](<https://github.com/GoodClover/OSM-Discord-bot/issues>), for bot or Discord suggestions please use `/suggest`.


# Basic controls

Helpers can react to a message with üóë to delete it.

Just typing `/` will show a list of all available commands from all bots.

If a message contains something such as `node/240095754`, `user TomH` or `note 834`, then the bot will add reactions that you can click:
* üîé - Embed showing info and image.
* üñº - Image. (elements only)
* üõè - Embed showing info.
* ‚ùå - Remove reactions and do nothing.


# `/taginfo`
`/taginfo <tag>`

Get details about a tag from [tag**info**](https://taginfo.openstreetmap.org/).
Accepts tag in the form `highway=*`, `building=house` or `water` (as key).

Statistics about tag usage will be shown, along with a short description of the tag, and it's image off the wiki.


# Suggestions with `/suggest`
`/suggest <suggestion>`

If you have a suggestion for this Discord server, such as a new emoji üòâ, use `/suggest` to post it. Suggestions appear in #suggestion-box.

Once you've posted a suggestion people will be able to vote on it, and eventually voting will be closed. (Hopefully with the words "accepted"!)


# `/josmtip` and `/googlebad`

View a tip for [JOSM](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/JOSM), or see your fate of mentioning Google.

All responses are from the [ohno-OSM](https://github.com/GoodClover/ohno-OSM) GitHub repo, feel free to contribute more!

A more interactive way to view the JOSM tips is planned‚Ä¶
