There are multiple ways to trigger inline commands.

- Paste ending of an OSM web link (`node/1`). 
- Mention element casually in the text such as:
  - node 1
  - ways 1 and 2
  - relations 1 and 2 or 3, 4 and 5
  - changeset 1 or 2
  - note 55 44
- Paste map fragment (`#map=3/0.0/0.0`)

Using inline command will usually make bot to react to your message with 4 emojis and you need to click on any of first 3 to see any results

- 🔎 (`:mag_right:`) - Full results to include both embeddeds and rendered map of elements
- 🖼️ (`:frame_photo:`) - Shows single map screenshot with all elements and notes
- 🛏️ (`:bed:`) - Shows every element's individual embedded.
- ❌ (`:x:`) - Cancel request, all emojis will be removed and bot posts nothing. Default action triggered if no input is detected in 15 seconds.
